This project is a privacy-preserving and decentralized alternative to the Dutch `#coronaApp`.

It will adhere to the technological demands published last week in the [‘Veilig tegen corona’ manifesto](https://www.veiligtegencorona.nl/).

The decode-proximity provides virus tracking and a warning system with a proximity alert. Every device broadcasts its proximity to other devices, privately recording when two people have been close (only the device owners know!).

If a user gets an alert from the device they can request a test for a corona diagnosis. If positive they can scan a QRCode from the GGD to anonymously upload a notice for all other users that have been close to them, to let them know of the risk.

❗ Please note: there are NO personal data stored on the central server. The secret key and the ephemeral ids can NOT be traced to identifiable people.

We are also developing a hardware port (This repository) to allow usage as a keyring and without a mobile phone

Using RIOT-OS+nimble on Nordic nRF52.

Using wolfSSL/wolfCrypt for TLS and crypto.

🚧 This software is in **ALPHA stage** and are part of the [DECODE project](https://decodeproject.eu) about data-ownership and [technological sovereignty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvBRbwBm_nQ). Our effort is that of improving people's awareness of how their data is processed by algorithms, as well facilitate the work of developers to create along [privacy by design principles](https://decodeproject.eu/publications/privacy-design-strategies-decode-architecture) using algorithms that can be deployed in any situation without any change.

## 💾 Install

Some dependencies are needed before you are able to build the project.

### Dependencies

You need to clone the RIOT-OS project [More details](https://doc.riot-os.org/getting-started.html).

Once you cloned the repo you have to reference it in the `RIOTBASE` variable of
the [Makefile](https://github.com/dyne/decode-proximity-hw/blob/master/Makefile#L8)


The GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain is also needed available on most operative systems
packaging systems eg.

```bash
gpt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```
### Building

To build the project jus run

```bash 
make
```
This will download all the submodule needed projects and compile.
